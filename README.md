# A Hunt Showdown loadout randomizer, which generates a random loadout from a list of weapons file.
But it's not just any loadout randomizer. The file contains info such as whether the weapon is good close range, or not, and the program uses this info to make a balanced loadout. 
So, for example, its not possible to get 2 melee weapons or 2 pistol pairs in 1 loadout. The program checks for that and prevents it from happening.
